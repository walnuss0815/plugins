Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on
performance, simplicity and security. It lets you seamlessly connect
computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on
Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android. It can be used to connect
a small number of computers, but is also able to connect tens of
thousands of computers.

Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption,
security groups, certificates, and tunneling, and each of those
individual pieces existed before Nebula in various forms. What makes
Nebula different to existing offerings is that it brings all of
these ideas together, resulting in a sum that is greater than its
individual parts.
